What is rust?
    - Systems language

Why rust?
    - Garbage collection
        - no need to manage it 
        - checks on demand when needed (different from Java)
        - efficient, best of both worlds
    - Package manager, Cargo (like pip from python)

# print.rs
- need to have a placeholder for printing variables

# vars.rs
- variables are immutable by default (can't reassign them)
- variables hold primitive data or referenced to data
- rust is a block-scoped language (a variable pertains to a scope (function))
